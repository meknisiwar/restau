/* This file defines the styles for the header on your homepage. 
    Make sure your image (e.g., food-drink-bg.jpg) is in the 
    public/images/ folder. The URL is relative to the CSS file's location,
    but it's generally best practice to keep all styles here and let 
    Symfony handle the paths if needed, though a simple relative path 
    from the CSS to the image in another public folder often works.
    The path '../images/...' assumes the CSS is in 'public/css/' 
    and the image is in 'public/images/'.
